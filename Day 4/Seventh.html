	<h1>An integer number greater than 1 is called a ​prime​ if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.<br>
		In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.<br>
		For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.<br>
		Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.<br>
		For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.<br>
		P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value</h1>
