	<h1>Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping.<br>
		So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products you want to buy.<br>
		Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list, but you want to add a few more.<br>
		Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the shoppingList array, and add some new products into it.
